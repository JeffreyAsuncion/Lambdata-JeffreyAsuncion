# Lambdata-JeffreyAsuncion
A collection of data science utility functions.



Implement at least 2 of the following "helper" utility functions:

- Train/validate/test split function for a dataframe

- State abbreviation -> Full Name and visa versa. FL -> Florida, etc. (Handle Washington DC and territories like Puerto Rico etc.)

- Function to split dates ("MM/DD/YYYY", etc.) into multiple columns

- Your idea here! (You will implement more later in the week as well)
