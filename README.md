# Lambdata-JeffreyAsuncion
A collection of data science utility functions.



Implement at least 2 of the following "helper" utility functions:
- Check a dataframe for nulls, print/report them in a nice "pretty" format
- Report a confusion matrix, with labels for easier interpretation
- Train/validate/test split function for a dataframe
- "Generate more data" function, takes dataframes and makes more rows
- Contingency table + Chi-squared report function: takes two categorical variables, outputs a contingency table and corresponding Chi-squared test
- Split addresses into multiple columns city, state zip -> df['city] df['state'] df['zip'] use regexes to detect format and pull out important pieces
- State abbreviation -> Full Name and visa versa. FL -> Florida, etc. (Handle Washington DC and territories like Puerto Rico etc.)
- Single function to take a list, turn it into a series and add it to a dataframe as a new column
- 1.5*Interquartile range outlier detection/removal function.
- Function to set notebook display options.
- Function to split dates ("MM/DD/YYYY", etc.) into multiple columns
- Your idea here! (You will implement more later in the week as well)
